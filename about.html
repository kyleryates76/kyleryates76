    <h1>Who We Are:</h1>
    <p class="conclude">There are two owners to this computer repair shop. The owners are Kyler Yates and John Crawford.
        They were aspiring information technology majors eager to jump out into the real world. They both shared the dream
        of opening up a computer repair shop. Now they both own 50% of the business Computer Renewal. Throughout studying computers
        from a child to now owning a repair shop. It is honestly anything I could ever ask for. I am very thankful I get to do
        my passion and help people out who are not as familiar with computers as I am.
    </p>
    <h1>Computer Renewal's History</h1>
    <p>Computer Renewal used to be a electronics store. It has a niftly location being on the town square.
        The electronics business eventually ended up selling the property to John and I. When we first generation
        the property, we needed to remodel. It was very dated in how it looked and we wanted to change that. After
        remodeling the place, we spent money on advertising and began to run our business. It started out slow
        since computer repair is not something that usually runs a ton of business, but it began to pick up. I am
        now glad to say that Computer Renewal is to place to go to get your computer hardware fixed. With Computer
        Renewal being the only computer repair shop in the area, we are glad to fill that niche.
    </p>
