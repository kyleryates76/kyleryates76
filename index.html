    <h1>What is Computer Renewal?</h1>
    <p>Computer Renewal is just your local computer repair shop. We take great pride in our work. The world is becoming more tech-savvy
        as we speak, we are here to acknowledge the technology left behind. Be it any old computer or phone, we take pride in repairing them
        back to factory conditions. We also deal with today's generation of technology. We can build you a computer, repair your computer,
        remove viruses and malware, and sell some general computer supplies while we're at it.
